                <h2>1. Don't ask to ask, just ask.</h2>

                Just ask your question, and provide as much information as possible. Asking to ask (i.e. by saying "<code>does anyone know anything about X?</code>") essentially:

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        "assigns" your question to the first person to say that they know anything about your topic, putting a huge burden on them to know the right answer without
                        even knowing what the question regards;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        discourages anyone other than the "assignee" from answering;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        may be dismissed as lazy and suggests that you have not the time nor energy to type out the question itself; let alone apply any advice that is given.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <div class="bad example">
                    <code>can anyone help me?</code>
                </div>

                <div class="bad example">
                    <code>does anyone know anything about fixing Steam downloads?</code>
                </div>

                <div class="good example">
                    <code>I've been having a lot of trouble with slow Steam downloads lately - they'll start off at 10 Mbps and drop down to 0 quickly. Does anyone know how to fix that?</code>
                </div>

            <section id="dont-say-hello">
                <h2>2. Don't say hello.</h2>

                As <a href="https://nohello.com/">nohello.com</a> masterfully puts it - saying "hello" and then not asking a question is similar to calling someone and immediately
                putting them on hold. Typing is slower than speaking, so your chat counterpart/ies will have to wait for type to say your question before they can actually answer
                it. By including your question in your initial greeting, you'll save yourself and your counterparty time.

                <br><br>

                <div class="bad example">
                    <code>Hello.<br>[typing, waiting, waiting...]<br>I've been having trouble with Steam downloads lately, can anyone...</code>
                </div>

                <div class="good example">

                <h2>3. Don't line-split.</h2>

                Typing out<br>
                your question<br>
                like this<br>
                floods<br>
                the chat<br>
                and is<br>
                generally<br>
                annoying to<br>

                <h2>4. Don't ask for help in private.</h2>

                Similarly, don't ask for help in voice/to screenshare - and don't offer help in private. Asking for help in these ways:
                
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        may be percieved as arrogant and lazy: those who would help you with your question are more likely than not unpaid volunteers at best and not your personal support agents;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        may direct your question to someone who simply doesn't know the answer, wasting the time of both you and your counterparty;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        walls off people who might actually know the answer to your question and will never have the chance to answer it because - quite frankly - you didn't ask them.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <div class="bad example">
                    <code>im not good at typing, can someone go on voice with me</code>
                </div>

                <div class="bad example">
                    <code>can you please dm me if you know how to fix this</code>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section id="dont-spam">
                <h2>5. Don't spam.</h2>

                Or: do not repeat your question multiple times in a short period or ask questions like "<code>can anyone help me?</code>". The room did probably see your question, and are
                probably not ignoring you - it's just that nobody knows how to answer your question. Make sure you posted in the correct spot, and ask your question again in a little while.

                Remember that there is another human on the other side of your screen. No one is required to answer your question, but those who spend time answering are
                volunteers, not your personal support agents, and generally act in good faith to help you come to a good resolution to your problem. Conduct yourself with grace,
                express gratitude, and be awesome to everyone.
